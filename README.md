E-commerce or Online Store with React.js, the most demanded tool for frontend developers. SHOPI is a web application that allows you to browse and buy fashion items easily and conveniently. The project uses a Fake API to fetch product data and simulate the shopping process. The application is developed using React, Vite.js and Tailwind. Leverages global state and two different contexts to handle user authentication and shopping cart. In addition, private and public paths are implemented to ensure the security of user information.

📌 Integration of a FAKE API: A fake Platzi API was implemented to simulate the collection of product data, which allowed creating a realistic and dynamic shopping experience.

📌 State and Context Management: The concept of state was used and two different contexts were created: one for user authentication and one for the shopping cart. 

📌 This facilitated the management of information throughout the application and improved efficiency in data manipulation.

📌 Private and public routes: Using authentication contexts, private and public routes were established. Users can only access certain sections of the application after logging in, ensuring data security and protection.

📌 Shopping cart functionalities: The ability to add products to the shopping cart, view and search for products, and group them by category was implemented. This improved the shopping experience for users and allowed them to browse and purchase products efficiently.

📌 Use of localStorage: localStorage was used to store purchase orders in the "My Orders" section. This ensures that users can access and review their previous orders even after logging out.
